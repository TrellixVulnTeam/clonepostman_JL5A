# clonepostman

A clone based on Postman!

Has the basic features such as landing page, a login form, GET, POST, etc... To start it, first open up on vscode and run npm start. If you don't have npm you need to get the npm extension and install node. Also, if npm start doesn't work after, try npm init -y, and then npm i (any of the packages which it says are missing)

Props to: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/postman-clone for giving me much of my structure for the main part!

Still working on it, and planning to add more features!
